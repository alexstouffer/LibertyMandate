<title>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Crypto&#39;s Future For the Music Industry | Liberty Mandate</title>
<meta name="description" content="One of the biggest critiques I&rsquo;ve encountered from bearish investors like Peter Schiff regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies as a whole is that it&rsquo;s intangible. The internet itself is intangible in the same sense, yet everyone uses it without thinking of the hardware, network layers, and other protocols that facilitate everything we do online. No one calls it a fad anymore, but they used to as well. Blockchain technology will progress in a similar fashion, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new value proposition that ties the tech to a swath of new real-world use cases, and music industry is only one facet of this upcoming economic boom.">

    <article  id="articleContent" class="post-content">
        <p>One of the biggest critiques I&rsquo;ve encountered from bearish investors like Peter Schiff regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies as a whole is that it&rsquo;s intangible. The internet itself is intangible in the same sense, yet everyone uses it without thinking of the hardware, network layers, and other protocols that facilitate everything we do online. No one calls it a fad anymore, but they used to as well. Blockchain technology will progress in a similar fashion, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new value proposition that ties the tech to a swath of new real-world use cases, and music industry is only one facet of this upcoming economic boom. First, let me explain what an NFT is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When something is fungible it means that it can be traded for any other unit of that type, because they hold the same value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dollars for instance are typically traded for other dollars on a daily basis, making them fungible. However, if the US mint were to make a mistake on a bill they will reprint it with a star rather than the letter of the issuing mint. These &lsquo;star notes&rsquo; are collectible to others that place a higher value on them than what they&rsquo;re worth at face value. That specific dollar becomes distinguishable from other dollars in circulation. We can see clearer examples with collectibles when we see that items like baseball cards can fetch high sums at public auctions. A Babe Ruth rookie card is something many baseball memorabilia collectors would like to have in their collection, yet few are willing to pay the price to acquire one let alone find one. NFTs act as certificates of authenticity and chain-of-custody that can prove that both physical and digital assets are authentic, while also layering the usefulness of smart contracts.</p>
<h3 id="music-related-use-cases">Music-Related Use Cases:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sell tickets for concerts that have set limits for resale (limiting scalpers).</li>
<li>Issue commercial rights to use music in film productions independently without BMI/ASCAP representation.</li>
<li>Provide artist royalties when content is re-sold on secondary markets.</li>
<li>Customized perks for fans like free tickets for life, chauffeur services, and exclusive access to content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s already a few avenues to get involved in the creation and sale of NFTs without having to know how to write code. Whether you choose a market like OpenSea or Rarible, the experience will be similar. Content creators connect a wallet like Metamask to their account and then use a process called Minting to create and take initial ownership of the created NFTs. Creators can then put their items up for sale for a listed price, and buyers have the option to make an offer or bid on the item below listing price. Once someone purchases that item from the seller, they buyer gains access to the files tied to that NFT per the smart contract specs. The specs also include fees that go to the original creator and marketplace. Almost all modern use cases pertaining to the music can remain in a digital only format.</p>
<h3 id="musicians-benefit">Musicians Benefit</h3>
<p>The state of affairs for musicians has been degrading since Napster disrupted the music industry&rsquo;s business model in the early 2000&rsquo;s. Record labels were stubborn to adopt new methods for distribution to their own detriment. Retail giants like Tower Records outright had to file for bankruptcy and get liquidated. 20 years later, record labels begrudgingly place their inventory on streaming music services like Spotify at fractions of what the IP was previously worth in royalty revenue. The fans also never truly own the content as it can be pulled from the libraries over contract issues or cancel culture.</p>
<p>NFTs allow independent artists to an equivalent of a Printing &amp; Distribution (P&amp;D) Deal without involving agents and managers at the cost of 25% - 50% of a creator&rsquo;s earned revenue. On the other side of the business relationship NFTs allow fans to once again own copies of the music they love, while shirking the external forces that mold Intellectual Property (IP) within a corporate container. The new business models have the potential to place the highest importance on the relationship between the artist and the fans. With the additional support of marketing services like SuperFone, which allows creators to communicate directly with fans via SMS texts, artists can have a complete business model operated solely by the individual creators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The QR Code is ubiquitous technology used in cryptocurrency transactions because it allows users to copy a recipient public key and avoid entering it into their transaction form manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="discovering-additional-use-cases">Discovering Additional Use Cases</h3>
<p>Everyone consumes form of digital content these days, so in an interesting twist the music storage medium-of-choice for physical collectors are peak analog technology: vinyl records and cassette tapes. Believe it or not, bands still sell them as merch at their shows. If you just stick a QR code on the inside of the cover art, you can claim ownership of the album&rsquo;s NFT and anything else that was designed to come with it. The same concept could apply with something like artist-series signiture guitars, or concert posters and t-shirts.</p>
<p>Are you interested in writing music for film or gaming? Start scoring scenes from your favorite movie or make mods that edit the background music for your favorite game. Once you&rsquo;re satisfied with a piece, put it on a marketplace with licenses for personal or commercial use. With increased reputation, people will seek you out rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Dont have a band? Why not contribute to tracks in progress and take literal ownership of the creative process. You could write the next hook that goes viral in every Tik-Tok video, and have people incorporate your sample into their profit-generating music through NFT contracts.</p>
<h3 id="personal-investment-picks-are-not-financial-advice">Personal Investment Picks (Are Not Financial Advice&hellip;)</h3>
<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is a massive ecosystem of crypto products built on ERC-20 tokens. It&rsquo;s allowed entreprenuers to launch their own crypto projects without having functioning blockchains built prior. Retail investors domestic and abroad spiked Ethereum to all-time highs in 2017 through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), despite crackdowns on these projects from regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission over Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. However, the ERC-20 token is only one protocol on the network. The NFT protocol ERC-721 tokens allow for network minting and distribution through Ethereum wallets. Most NFTs currently trade for Ethereum rather than a marketplace coin or stablecoin. Recommended Exchange: Coinbase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lukso.network/">Lukso (LYXe)</a> as a value proposition wants to do for NFTs what the ERC-20 token has done for ICOs. It will allow people to issue their own NFT platforms and marketplaces without having to know how to code. it&rsquo;s a product co-founded by Fabian Vogelsteller and his wife Marjorie Hernandez. They have both done extensive work for the Ethereum Foundation, with Vogelsteller in particular being credited for creating the first Web3 Wallet and the Web3.js library. He also made the initial proposal for the ERC-20 token that led to Ethereum&rsquo;s boom. Hernandez in her own right has extensive experience with her contributions to branding and marketing with the IOTA foundation. She no doubt is the driving force for fashion brands worldwide to take interest in the technology as demonstrated through their business connections with Nike, Channel, &amp; Burberry. Nike&rsquo;s crypto kicks will most likely launch through Lukso&rsquo;s network. Recommended Exchange: KuCoin.</p>
<p><a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink (LINK)</a> is at this moment known for its involvment in the space of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), but their reliability at providing price information as an oracle service is indespensible when crypto projects want to be able to provide price information to services outside of their blockchain. Chainlink has big plans to work with NFT services with details that are rolling out slowly. Still, with the impact that Link has on DeFi it seems highly probable that the same services will be handy for an adjacent crypto sector. There are even DeFi-NFT projects that provide things like insurance for crypto trades.</p>
<p>Also worth noting are <a href="https://phantasma.io/home">Phantasma (SOUL)</a> &amp; <a href="https://bondly.finance/">Bondly.finance (BONDLY)</a>. Both interoperate with eachother and allow for staking of their coins. They are two projects who may be first to market when it comes to incorporating music and sports industries. They both are doing broad work in providing NFTs through gaming dApps with other competitors like Enjin Coin and WAX.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: Author is holding bags in Ethereum, Lukso, and Chainlink. Only invest once you&rsquo;ve satisfied any questions worth researching.</p>
