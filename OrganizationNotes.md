# Local Chapters
Get benefit of existing national organization infrastructure
    - Use same shop as national organization to fill orders without hiring labor or housing products.
    - Volunteering is directed through Main Org so local chapters dont need to train new volunteers.
    - They can import a feed from the national news aggregation and moderate it with local content, less production cost.
    - Do not need to create designs or products.
    - Sales coordinators & chapter founder receive a sales commission to encourage sales and promote the culture.
    - Chapters need only operate their CRM and CMS via web portals. No code needed.
