1. Coders: Help us build the infrastructure to get more people posters by contributing pull requests to [our repository](https://github.com/alexstouffer/LibertyMandate) on a new branch, and addressing [issues](https://github.com/alexstouffer/LibertyMandate/issues) that hinder our progress.
2. Everyone: Invite people you know to join our [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/SoCalMandateProtest) where they can get updates from us as things progress.
